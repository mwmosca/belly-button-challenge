## Context
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset [http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/] catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. This project offers an interactive dashboard to explore the data.
